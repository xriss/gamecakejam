Some quick and dirty gamecake games, built in a few hours as test packages. you could try and play them or you could take them and use them as a base for your own creations. Play with them, change the grafix, have fun, that's why they exist.

The GameCake system enables these games to work on:

LINUX
My main build is tested on ubuntu (+gnome3).

WINDOWS
Wine and XP compatible only with the focus on wine.

RASPBERRY PI
With or without X11, this is a native raspbian build and can be run from the commandline.
The RASPI is also "minimum required specs" if your machine is not as powerful as one of these then don't expect everything to work.

ANDROID
You have a keyboard/gamepad right?

NACL
The web solution...

The exact state of these platforms is currently in a state of flux due to on going development.

The windows build should always work under wine so it is perversely the most compatible cross platform build.Â 

Finally can I also add a big fuck you to MICROSOFT, METRO, IOS, APPLE, AMAZON, STEAM, PLAYSTATION, XBOX and NINTENDO platforms.  None of this would be possible without your continued and tireless attempts to destroy all unapproved creativity.
